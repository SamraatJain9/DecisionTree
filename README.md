# DecisionTree

Goal: To be able to create a decision tree using voice inputs and text inputs
Manually Be able to edit the final tree.

Components of a Decision Tree:
- Root Node: Topmost node/first/node we start the tree from.
- Decision (Internal) Nodes: Nodes representing the point where a decision needs to be made (based on an attribute or feature) to further split the data into two or more variables. 
- Leaf Nodes: These are the endpoints and have no child nodes (no nodes branching out from them). This is where the answer or the solution is found.
- Branches: Is a specific section of a decision tree that contains multiple internal nodes and potentially some leaf nodes.
- Splitting Criteria: Is the rule or criteria used to split (divide) the data into subsets. 
- Pruning:  Is the process of slimming down variables by removing the nodes, leaving only the most critical nodes (the only ones that are relevant) and potential outcomes. Pruning is used when creating a Decision Tree from a given dataset to eliminate irrelevant or unnecessary nodes, simplifying the model and improving its performance.

Two Types:
1. Classification Trees: Yes or No
2. regression Trees: Numerical Value Based
